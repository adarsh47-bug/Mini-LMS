### React Native Expo Developer Assignment

## Overview

Build a Mini LMS Mobile App using React Native Expo that demonstrates
proficiency in native features, WebView integration, and state
management.
API Base: https://api.freeapi.app/

## About This Assignment

We are seeking highly skilled and motivated React Native developers
proficient in modern mobile development. Candidates must be adept at
building efficient, scalable, and secure mobile applications using
React Native Expo, including asynchronous programming, API
integration, native module implementation, state management, and
performance optimization.

#### What We Expect From You

We don't expect a basic mobile app with simple API calls. We want you
to showcase your intellect and approach to developing impactful mobile
applications, demonstrating sophisticated problem-solving and
innovative solutions that go beyond technical proficiency. Your
project should reflect critical thinking, analytical capabilities, and
strategic design for valuable, transformative mobile experiences, from
ideation to scalable implementation.
This assignment tests your ability to:
● Bridge the gap between native functionality and web content
● Handle complex state management and data persistence
● Build performant, production-ready mobile applications
● Implement security best practices
● Solve real-world mobile development challenges


## Technology Stack

#### Mandatory Technologies

```
● Framework: React Native Expo (latest stable SDK)
● Language: TypeScript (strict mode enabled)
● Data Persistence:
○ Expo SecureStore (for sensitive data)
○ AsyncStorage or MMKV (for app data)
● Navigation: Expo router
● Styling: NativeWind (Tailwind for React Native)
```
#### Optional Technologies (Bonus Points)

```
● Testing: Jest + React Native Testing Library
● Error Tracking: Sentry or custom solution
● Analytics: Expo Analytics or custom implementation
● Forms: React Hook Form
● Validation: Zod or Yup
● Image Handling: Expo Image with caching
● AI Integration: OpenAI SDK for smart course recommendations
```

1.2 Profile Screen


```
● Display user profile information
● Allow profile picture update
● Show user statistics (courses enrolled, progress)
```
#### Part 2: Course Catalog (Native Implementation)

2.1 Course List
● Fetch data from /api/v1/public/randomusers (treat as course
instructors)
● Fetch data from /api/v1/public/randomproducts (treat as courses)
● Display courses in a scrollable list with:
○ Course thumbnail
○ Instructor name
○ Course title and description
○ Bookmark icon
● Implement pull-to-refresh
● Add search functionality to filter courses
2.2 Course Details Screen
● Show complete course information
● Add "Enroll" button with visual feedback
● Implement bookmark toggle with local storage

#### Part 3: WebView Integration

3.1 Embedded Content Viewer
● Create a WebView screen that displays course content
● Load a simple HTML page showing course details (you can create a
local HTML template)
● Implement basic communication from Native app to Webview using
headers

#### Part 4: Native Features

4.1 Local Notifications
● Request notification permissions
● Show notification when user bookmarks 5+ courses


```
● Add notification when user hasn't opened app for 24 hours
(reminder)
```
#### Part 5: State Management & Performance

5.1 State Management
● Implement global state using Expo Secure Store and React native
async storage for situation-specific
Manage:
○ Authentication state
○ Course list and bookmarks
○ User preferences
5.2 List Optimization
● Implement LegendList with proper optimization
● Use keyExtractor and proper item keys
● Implement basic memoization for list items
● Add pull-to-refresh without UI jank

#### Part 6: Error Handling

6.1 Network Errors
● Handle API failures with a retry mechanism
● Show user-friendly error messages
● Implement timeout handling
● Add offline mode banner
6.2 WebView Error Handling
● Handle failed WebView loads

## Deliverables

1. Source Code
